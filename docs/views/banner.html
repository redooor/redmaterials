                <h2>Note to users</h2>
                <p>Version 0.0.2 is an incomplete release. We're constantly adding new features to Redmaterials. We appreciate your patience and welcome all contributions. Meanwhile, do expect that some things (specifically those elements that are not inherited from Bootstrap) are not confirmed and may be removed from future releases. We'll try as much as possible to retain the components inherited from Bootstrap.</p>

#Redmaterials by Redooor

Redmaterials is a Bootstrap theme inspired by Google Material Design and various projects.
It is a consolidation of many works by various people. Please refer to [Acknowledgement](#acknowledgement) for more information.

Redmaterials was initially developed/consolidated by Redooor to be used in another open-sourced project [Redminportal](https://github.com/redooor/redminportal). We've decided to create a separate open-sourced project and make it available to the public.

# Note to users

Version 0.0.2 is an incomplete release. We're constantly adding new features to Redmaterials. We appreciate your patience and welcome all contributions. Meanwhile, do expect that some things (specifically those elements that are not inherited from Bootstrap) are not confirmed and may be removed from future releases. We'll try as much as possible to retain the components inherited from Bootstrap.
